# This is the Open Source Tuberculosis (OSTB) General Repository
This page describes the basics of OSTB. For more detail, go to the wiki (link above). To ask a question, post an Issue (also above).

OSTB is for anyone interested in working on TB in an open source manner. "Open source" means that you work in line with the Six Laws.

There is a basic [Landing Page](http://opensourcetb.org/) which imports activity, but which needs an update. Updates go to [Twitter](https://twitter.com/OpenSourceTB). All OSTB molecules are on the [Master List](http://tinyurl.com/OSTBCompounds). Github (what you're looking at) is used for discussion and for file sharing. Different parts of OSTB have different "repositories" or "repos", from the General (what you're looking at) to the specific (such as the repo for Series 1). Discussion takes place by posting, and replying to, Issues (link above). To contribute, get a Github account.

There is an old [Google+ community](https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/101893553189762547680) that could be resurrected. There is an email address (opensourcetb@gmail.com) but email is discouraged because it is bilateral.
